# Attention Prediction using Eye-Tracking Data

## Project Aim and Exploration
The aim of the project will be to predict the level of text comprehension using the reader's eye movement data. After each indivitual 
read 4 published SAT passages, they had to answer corresponding SAT and selfevaluation questionnaires.
The scores from these questionnaires can act as a metric for measuring `attention` of a reader.

In the project, we will try to explore different dimensions and answer some questions like:
- Can the eye movement of an `indivitual` over a specific passage be used to predict the attention on other passages.
- Can the eye movement of an `indivitual` over a specific passage be used to predict the attention of other subject on the same passage. 
- Can the eye movement generalize by predicing `attention` of any subject on any passage.
- Exploring the importance of features while predicitng.
- Carrying out statistical tests to verify whether native english speakers tend to be more attentive than non-native.
- Carrying out statistical tests to verify whether subject's cognitive and mental states effects attention level.

## Dataset Description
I will be using the public eye-movement data available here:
```
https://github.com/ahnchive/SB-SAT
```

It consists of the eye movement data from 95 undergraduate students reading four SAT passages for comprehension, and their responses on comprehension questions and selfevaluation questionnaires (e.g., subjective difficulty of passage).
All reading passages and questions were selected from the SAT
practice set from their official website: https://collegereadiness.
